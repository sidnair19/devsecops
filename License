### **2. Schedule Regular Security Audits**
To ensure your application remains secure, schedule regular security audits using Jenkins.

#### Steps to Schedule Security Audits:
1. **Add a Cron Job in Jenkins**:
   - Open your Jenkins pipeline job configuration.
   - Add a cron schedule to trigger the pipeline periodically.
   - Example: `H H * * 0` (runs every Sunday at midnight).

2. **Add a Security Audit Stage**:
   - Modify your `Jenkinsfile` to include a dedicated stage for security audits:
     ```groovy
     pipeline {
         agent any

         triggers {
             cron('H H * * 0')  // Run every Sunday at midnight
         }

         stages {
             stage('Security Audit') {
                 steps {
                     script {
                         sh 'trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL myapp:latest'
                         sh 'npm audit'
                     }
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Monitor Audit Results**:
   - Check the Jenkins pipeline logs for security scan results.
   - Address any vulnerabilities identified by Trivy or `npm audit`.

### **3. Monitor and Improve**
Continuous monitoring and improvement are essential for maintaining a secure and efficient application.

#### Steps to Monitor and Improve:
1. **Set Up Monitoring**:
   - Use IBM Cloud Monitoring to track application performance, logs, and errors.
   - Set up alerts for critical issues (e.g., high CPU usage, failed deployments).

2. **Update Dependencies**:
   - Regularly update your project dependencies to patch vulnerabilities:
     ```bash
     npm update
     npm audit fix
     ```

3. **Improve the CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Regularly review the pipeline for bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
   - Add new security tools or practices as needed (e.g., OWASP ZAP, SonarQube).

4. **Conduct Code Reviews**:
   - Perform regular code reviews to ensure code quality and security.
   - Use tools like ESLint for static code analysis.

5. **Document Changes**:
   - Keep the `README.md` and other documentation up to date with any changes or improvements.

### **Example Maintenance Checklist**
| Task                          | Frequency       | Tools/Methods                     |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Run security scans            | Weekly          | Trivy, `npm audit`                |
| Update dependencies           | Monthly         | `npm update`, `npm audit fix`     |
| Review CI/CD pipeline         | Quarterly       | Jenkins, IBM Cloud Monitoring    |
| Conduct code reviews          | Every PR        | GitHub, ESLint                   |
| Monitor application performance | Continuously   | IBM Cloud Monitoring             |

### **4. Automate Maintenance Tasks**
Automate repetitive maintenance tasks using Jenkins or scripts:
- **Automate Dependency Updates**:
  Use tools like [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates.
- **Automate Security Scans**:
  Use Jenkins to schedule and run security scans.
